1.Explain in brief the need of hive.
HiveQL is like SQL based querying language.
Those who are weak at programming instead of writing complex mapreduce programs ,
they can do the same with hive easily.
100s of lines of complex code in mapreduce can be written in just 4 lines of hiveQL.
It is automatically converted to mapreduce jobs by the execution engine.
Since it follows SQL based queries it is easy to understand and code.

2.Is Hive suitable to be used for OLTP systems? Explain in brief.
